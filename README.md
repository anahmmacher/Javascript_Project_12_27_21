Name : Arthur Nahmmacher


Project Summary & Functionality :
I will be making a data visualization of a report by the WHO with regards to
alcohol cosumption by Country between 2010 - 2019.
I want to use an interactive map that can change values depending on data
filters and also being able to provide data on the individual countries by 
clicking on them on the map.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs :
    D3.js seems to be one of the better libraries in terms of what it can do,
    and it offers geographical maps, which I want, but I'm worried about the 
    learning curve. Google charts seems to be another option since it too has
    maps, but it really lacks in visuals and animation options


MVP List :

instructions, World map, data filter options, hover legend, pop-up section 
for individual country data.


overall progress:
The World map is showing and I was able to make a crude legend, since there's not much interactivity at the moment, I don't have instructions.
creating the map took most of my time. importing and mainipulating the data was more challenging than expected. Started working on way to sort data
rerender map, but ran out of time. This will be implemented in the final version later on.
